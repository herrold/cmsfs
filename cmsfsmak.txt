INSTALL <plaintext> 2001-Feb-01 (Thu) CMSFSMAK TXT
 
This file explains how to build the CMS FS utility and/or driver.
To build the package as a filesystem driver,  see the end of this doc.
There is presently NOT a  'make install'  step,  so you will
have to manually copy or move the resulting executables to the
searchable directory of your choice.
 
Extract the TAR file.
This should result in the creation of a "cmsfs" directory.
(A copy of this file is in the archive and will be in that directory.)
Get into that directory,  and issue the commands
 
                ./configure
                make clean
                make all
 
There will be five executables:
 
        cmsfscat, cmsfslst, cmsfsvol, cmsfscp, and cmsfsck
 
To get 'cmsfsck' handled by /sbin/fsck,  rename it to "fsck.cms"
and copy it to /sbin.   With /sbin/fsck.cms in place,  on can add
CMS volumes to /etc/fstab and have them pass start-up FS checks.
Of course,  if they don't pass,  Linux won't come all the way up.
YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.
 
To get CMS volumes mounted automatically,  they must be
listed in /etc/fstab and you must also arrange for the driver
to be installed at start-up,  or mark them as  "noauto".
(See the "build the package as a driver" section below.)
YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.
 
The man pages have not been updated in several months.
 
You should also find one or more sample disk images in the "dsk"
sub-directory.  These were read directly from CMS minidisk volumes
(with 'dd' on mainframe Linux) and can be used to verify the utility
wherever real CMS minidisks are unavailable, like on a Solaris system.
A CMS minidisk image of 1474560 bytes can be copied (with 'dd')
onto a 1.44M floppy.   Try it!
 
To build the package as a driver ...
 
                ./configure
                make clean
                make module
                insmod cmsfs.o
                mount -r -t cms /dev/dasdx /mnt
