Subject:      Re: UTS 'cmsread' syntax
To: LINUX-390@VM.MARIST.EDU
 
Note that's it readcms and not cmsread.  From UTS 2.1.7.
 
readcms      -vmid id -addr xxx -pw pass  -m mode
           -f fname.ftype  -o ofile -bl -bi
 
-vmid id    Uses id as the vmid to LINK to.
 
-addr xxx   Uses xxx as the virtual  disk  address  for
            the LINK command.
 
-pw pass    Uses pw as the read password for  the  LINK
            command.   If  this  is  not specified, and
            -vmid and -addr are, the system prompts for
            the    password   without   echoing.    See
            getpass(3C).
 
-m mode     Selects only files with the specified  mode
            number between 1 and 5.
 
-f fname.ftype
            Causes the CMS file  with  name  fname  and
            type ftype to be copied, if specified.
 
-o fname    Causes the  file  specified  by  -f  to  be
            copied  to  UTS file fname.  If you specify
            -f and  not  -o,  the  file  is  copied  to
            standard output.
 
-bl         Causes the file specified by -f to  have  a
            newline  character added to the end of each
            record.  This is not appropriate  for  some
            binary files.
 
-bi         Causes the file specified by -f to  not  be
            translated  from  EBCDIC to ASCII.  This is
            needed for copying binary files.
 
 
 
Can someone report the syntax of ye olde 'cmsread' command from UTS??
 
Thanks!
